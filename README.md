# AdaptiGuard

Which paper is current, and what each manuscript may claim: [docs/PAPERS_STATUS.md](docs/PAPERS_STATUS.md).

AdaptiGuard is an empirical case study showing how **measurement decisions in the evaluation of LLM-agent defenses can change conclusions on the same underlying traces**. The study re-scores and re-analyzes frozen runs of tool-using LLM agents under prompt-injection attacks, and examines how the choice of success endpoint, labeling rule and reporting unit changes what a defense evaluation appears to show.

This repository does **not** present a state-of-the-art defense, a production-ready security defense, or a general-purpose benchmark for all agents.

## Research focus

The study concentrates on measurement decisions in the evaluation of runtime defenses, treated as candidate checks rather than a validated framework:

- **Success endpoint**: whether an attack counts as successful when the model proposes a call or when the executor runs it.
- **Blocked-payload labeling**: how payloads stopped by a defense are labeled.
- **Scenario validity**: whether a scenario contains an attacker-controlled effect at all.
- **Authorship independence**: who wrote the attack scenarios relative to the defense under test.
- **Per-model reporting and noise floor**: whether results are reported per model and compared against run-to-run noise.
- **Defense-channel verification**: whether the defense is actually applied to the untrusted channel.

## Main research package

The publication package lives in [`docs/paper/negative_result/`](docs/paper/negative_result/):

- Manuscript: [`MANUSCRIPT_DRAFT_v1.md`](docs/paper/negative_result/MANUSCRIPT_DRAFT_v1.md) (assembled from the source sections in the same directory; do not edit by hand)
- Figures 1 to 3 (csv, png, svg): [`figures/`](docs/paper/negative_result/figures/)
- References: [`RELATED_WORK.md`](docs/paper/negative_result/RELATED_WORK.md) and [`references_extension.bib`](docs/paper/q1_findings/references_extension.bib)
- Number ledger: [`NUMBERS_LEDGER.md`](docs/paper/negative_result/NUMBERS_LEDGER.md)
- Appendices: [`APPENDIX_A_EXPLORATORY_PILOT.md`](docs/paper/negative_result/APPENDIX_A_EXPLORATORY_PILOT.md), [`APPENDIX_B_CHECKLIST.md`](docs/paper/negative_result/APPENDIX_B_CHECKLIST.md), [`APPENDIX_C_ARTIFACTS.md`](docs/paper/negative_result/APPENDIX_C_ARTIFACTS.md), [`APPENDIX_D_E3_DETAILED_RESULTS.md`](docs/paper/negative_result/APPENDIX_D_E3_DETAILED_RESULTS.md)
- Package index: [`README.md`](docs/paper/negative_result/README.md)

The preregistration text in this package is a local draft; the external test was not externally registered.

## Reproduce

```bash
git clone https://github.com/matin-shirazi/Adapti-guard.git
cd adapti-guard
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate          # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -e ".[dev]"            # requires Python >= 3.12
pytest -q                          # offline suite; no live LLM required
```

Manuscript assembly and the number-ledger consistency check:

```bash
python scripts/assemble_manuscript.py
pytest -q tests/test_manuscript_number_ledger.py
```

Offline regeneration of the manuscript numbers:

```bash
pip install -r requirements-core.txt            # pins matplotlib==3.11.2
STRICT=1 bash scripts/reproduce_negative_result.sh
```

This regenerates the E1 to E4 analyses, the three figures, `NUMBERS_LEDGER.md` and the manuscript from the committed traces, runs the ledger consistency test, and with `STRICT=1` fails if a regenerated file differs from the committed copy (details in [`REPRODUCIBILITY.md`](REPRODUCIBILITY.md)). It does **not** regenerate the external-test (InjecAgent, manuscript §6.6 and §6.7) analysis: those scripts and the external InjecAgent checkout are not in this repository, and the script skips those steps.

**What is public and what is not.** Public in the tree: the frozen packs, the committed traces and derived artifacts, the offline analysis, figure, ledger and reproduction scripts, the manuscript sources. **Not** in the tree of any public branch or tag: the live multi-turn harness (`src/adapti_guard/evaluation/harness_v2/`) and its test, the E2/E3 run scripts, the calibration and InjecAgent run and analysis scripts, the attack-template files, per-episode trajectories, and the archive `case-study-v1` (no such tag exists on the public remote). Several of these exist in commits of the original history that can be fetched by full SHA but are not reachable from any branch or tag and are not guaranteed to persist; see `REPRODUCIBILITY.md`. The full harness is therefore **not** publicly released.

Never commit `.env` or API keys. Copy `.env.example` only if you intentionally run live providers.

## Repository layout

| Path | Role |
|------|------|
| `src/adapti_guard/` | Installable package (`import adapti_guard`) |
| `configs/` | YAML/JSON configs |
| `scripts/` | CLI entrypoints, including manuscript assembly and figure scripts |
| `tests/` | Pytest, including the number-ledger check |
| `docs/paper/negative_result/` | Manuscript package (main research package) |
| `datasets/` | Frozen packs and pinned external samples; frozen packs are read-only |
| `experiments/` | Run artifacts, including the external InjecAgent runs cited by the manuscript; read-only |

## Research status

- Manuscript package: verified
- Manuscript assembly: verified
- Number-ledger validation: verified
- CI: passing
- Historical and live evaluation artifacts: frozen and read-only where applicable
- Full historical reproduction: not possible from the public tree (live harness, run scripts and external-test scripts are absent)

## Limitations

- The study examines measurement validity; it makes no general claim that any defense is better than another.
- Some historical artifacts and harness dependencies remain outside this publication transfer.
- Frozen evidence must not be re-run or modified without an explicit human gate.

## Historical material

Earlier dual-track work (a confirmatory negative result and a separate scoped result on a different pack) and its workshop packet are kept for provenance and are not the main result of this study: [`docs/paper/dual_track/`](docs/paper/dual_track/), [`docs/paper/workshop_vnext_fail/`](docs/paper/workshop_vnext_fail/), [`docs/paper/q1_findings/`](docs/paper/q1_findings/), [`docs/archive/`](docs/archive/). Reviewer entry point for the repository as a whole: [`docs/START_HERE.md`](docs/START_HERE.md).
